ADMIN UI- GEEKTRUST FRONTEND CHALLANGE

Objective- An application used to display users detail, search the user on all property- name, email, role. Can delete, edit single or multiple users. 

Reflection
This is a Geektrust Frontend Challange- Admin UI. I have used React Js technology to implement the project. To get the API response I have used React state & hooks. Users are displayed in Table (Table material ui is used) with their name, email, role and actions (delete or edit). There is search bar to filter the user on property name, email and role and due to pagination implemented it will automatically display the filtered users and will reduce the number of pages based on filtered user data. Clicking on the page number will display the users for that particular page. 

One can delete or edit the user detail in place and can also delete multiple rows by selecting the checkbox and clicking on delete selected button at bottom. All the users can be selected by clicking on the top checkbox and this will ensure that to select the users present on current page instead all the users. The selected users are displayed with grayish background. 

To edit the detail of user, click on edit icon, it will open a dialogue box in which you can fill out the details , this is implemented in editUser. 

































# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\


The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
